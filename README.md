# Data Communication Lab Code - IOE

This repository hosts MATLAB source codes and corresponding PNG output images for Data Communication lab experiments conducted at the Institute of Engineering (IOE). It also includes a comprehensive PDF report covering Labs 1 to 5, exploring signal processing, modulation techniques, and waveform analysis.


## Overview

The lab experiments cover:
-Fundamental arithmetic and matrix operations using MATLAB.
-Visualization of line plots, trigonometric waves (sine and cosine), and discrete signals.
-Simulation of key signal functions including unit step, square wave, signum, ramp, impulse, and noise.
-Implementation of modulation methods such as Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Phase Modulation (PM), and digital modulation techniques like Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase  Shift Keying (PSK).
-Analysis of even and odd functions, sinc functions, and exponentially decaying signals.


## Contents

- **Source Codes**: MATLAB `.m` scripts for each lab task
- **Output Images**: PNG files of all generated plots
- **Full Report**: PDF summarizing each labâ€™s objective, code, and output


## Installation

### Option 1: MATLAB

- **Software**: [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- **Steps**:
  1. Install MATLAB.
  2. Open a script (e.g., `sine_wave_plot.m`) in the MATLAB environment.
  3. Run it by typing the filename (without `.m`) in the command window.

> A 30-day trial version is available on the MathWorks website.

### Option 2: Online Compilers

#### myCompiler (Octave-based)
- **Link**: [myCompiler.io](https://www.mycompiler.io/new/octave)
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a new Octave project.
  2. Paste the MATLAB code.
  3. Click "Run".

#### Octave Online
- **Link**: [Octave Online](https://octave-online.net/)
- **Steps**:
  1. Paste or upload `.m` files.
  2. Press "Run" to execute the code.


## Usage

- Browse the MATLAB `.m` files to understand and experiment with signal generation.
- Run scripts to view real-time results or review the included `.png` plots.
- Refer to the PDF report for theoretical context and lab summaries.
